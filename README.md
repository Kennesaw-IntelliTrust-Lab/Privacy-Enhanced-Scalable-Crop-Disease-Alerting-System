# Rice Disease Detection

This project provides a machine learning solution for detecting rice diseases using image classification. It employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify rice leaf images into different disease categories. The model is trained and validated using a dataset of rice leaf images.

## Features

- **Disease Detection**: Classify rice leaf images into disease categories.
- **Data Augmentation**: Includes data augmentation techniques for better model generalization.
- **Model Training**: Trains a CNN model with early stopping, learning rate reduction, and accuracy monitoring.
- **Prediction**: Predicts the disease from new images and visualizes the result.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mchantiraju123/rice-disease-detection.git
